# Opher

## Overview
Opher is a next-generation virtual currency designed to be globally accepted and secure.  
The main goal of this project is to provide a decentralized and scalable financial system that enables fast, low-cost transactions worldwide.

Key features:
- Decentralized blockchain network
- Fast transaction validation
- Secure and tamper-proof ledger
- Scalable for global usage

## How  
The typical transaction flow in Opher:
1. User initiates a transaction.
2. Transaction is broadcast to the Opher network.
3. Nodes validate and reach consensus on the transaction.
4. Transaction is included in a new block.
5. Block is added to the blockchain, completing the transaction.    

## Validation 
- Consensus Mechanism: PoW + BFT 
- Cryptographic Signatures: Ensures only the owner can authorize a transaction
- Double-Spending Protection: Prevents multiple spends of the same coins
- Block Verification: Nodes verify each block before appending it to the blockchain 
- Hybrid transaction model: UTXO + Account-based
